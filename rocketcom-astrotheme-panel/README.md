## About This Plugin

This panel plugin is primarly a theme plugin. It provides CSS style overrides for the Grafana dashboard in order to theme the dashboard with the [Astro UXDS](https://www.astrouxds.com) design system. It also provides options for a classification banner, clock, light/dark theme switching, and setting a default theme. The Astro Panel _must_ be added to a dashboard in order for styles to take effect. Navigation inside of the Grafana dashboard will retain the plugin's overrides, but moving away from the dashboard will cause the styles to revert back to Grafana defaults.
