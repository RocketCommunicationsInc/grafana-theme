[![Build](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-starter-panel/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-starter-panel/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI%22)

This template is a starting point for building Grafana Panel Plugins in Grafana 7.0+

## What is Grafana Panel Plugin?

Panels are the building blocks of Grafana. They allow you to visualize data in different ways. While Grafana has several types of panels already built-in, you can also build your own panel, to add support for other visualizations.

For more information about panels, refer to the documentation on [Panels](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/panels/panels/)

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   or

## About This Plugin

This panel plugin is primarly a theme plugin. It provides CSS style overrides for the Grafana dashboard in order to theme the dashboard with [Astro UXDS](www.astrouxds.com) colors and typography. It also provides options for a classification banner, clock, light/dark theme switching, and setting a default theme. Due to Grafana limitations, the Astro plugin _must be visible_ in order to take effect. Navigation inside of the Grafana dashboard will retain the plugin's overrides, but moving away from the dashboard will cause the styles to revert back to Grafana defaults.

## Panel Options

- Default theme
  - Sets the default theme that the dashboard will use.
- Hide Theme Picker
  - Hides the light/dark button that provides theme switching.
- Classification Banner
  - Provides all clearance level classfication banners at the top of the Astro panel.
- Include Clock
  - Shows or hides the clock.
- Format
  - Allows user to choose left, center, or right alignemnt for the panel content.
